/**
 * The goal of theses micro-benchmarks is to check how fast 
 * merge can be and to compare different implementations.
 *
 * It does not expect to exhibit real world performances since data
 * will always be in the CPU cache.
 * 
 * We also check the scalability of the merge operation. It is not thread safe 
 * in upstream (as for 2.4.0) so the resulting register set is obviously broken.
 * But the performance data can be used to compare an alternative thread safe 
 * implementation to the maximum achievable performance.
 * 
 * TODO: I'm not sure there is a real use case for concurrent merges
 * TODO: Perhaps remove scalability tests. A better test case with 
 * TODO: concurrent offers and merge would most likely be more relevant.
